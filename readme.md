# A Kumon scoring system

This project is to encourage a little friendly competition in Kumon effort and participation.

My kids study Kumon - a paid English and Maths tutoring system with papers. They wanted trophies and to get competitive about it. So I created a scoring system for them.
In code - they can see and we can discuss the rules, and use that to award trophies.

With the trophies (3D printed) came movie night choose-the-movie privileges.

## Requirements

A requirements.txt is bundled with this, it requires python 3 otherwise.
The English and Maths notebooks are Jupyter notebooks. I've been using VSCode to run them.

## Suggested trophies

For English, because we enjoy imaginative fiction, a dragon trophy - https://www.thingiverse.com/make:962578.

For maths, because I'm a fan of the Serpinski triangle and fractaline structures, I chose https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24714. It's also linked with computer games - so a hit with the kids.
