# A Kumon scoring system

This project is to encourage a little friendly competition in Kumon effort and participation.

My kids study Kumon - a paid English and Maths tutoring system with papers. They wanted trophies and to get competitive about it. So I created a scoring system for them.
In code - they can see and we can discuss the rules, and use that to award trophies.

With the trophies (3D printed) came movie night choose-the-movie privileges.

## Requirements

A requirements.txt is bundled with this, it requires python 3 otherwise.
The English and Maths notebooks are Jupyter notebooks. I've been using VSCode to run them.
