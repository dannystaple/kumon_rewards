        # Date - the date the paper was taken - recorded for now, but so only a week is counted.
        # Duration - the time the paper took to complete in minutes
        # grades - these are what go into the Kumon score card. For maths, these are the number 100 (for 100%), then A through D (or poorer). For English this is the number of mistakes.
        # Completed in time - did they complete before the cut off.
        # Corrections completed - did they finish all the corrections - doesn't count if they didn't.
        # Sequence number - for holidays and long times away from the Kumon centre - children will be given many numbered papers.
        #  parents/tutors want to encourage them to be done in order. Optional and defaults to None.
